<p>These are rough, so join the #mongrel2 channel on irc.freenode.org for more direct help.</p>

<p>To get the source, first you need to go to <a href="http://www.fossil-scm.org/download.html">fossil downloads</a> and download a static binary for your platform.</p>

<p>Next do this:</p>

<pre>
mkdir ~/fossils
fossil clone http://mongrel2.org:44445/ ~/fossils/mongrel2.fossil
mkdir -p ~/projects/mongrel2
cd ~/projects/mongrel2
fossil open ~/fossils/mongrel2.fossil
</pre>

<p>If you are registered as a committer then your clone line is actually:</p>

<pre>
fossil clone http://YOU@mongrel2.org:44445/ ~/fossils/mongrel2.fossil
</pre>

<p>After that you can check out [GettingStarted] or <a href="/doc/tip/docs/manual/book.wiki">The Manual</a> to do more.</p>
