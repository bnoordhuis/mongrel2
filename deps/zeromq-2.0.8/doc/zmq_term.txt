NAME
----
zmq_term - terminate 0MQ context


SYNOPSIS
--------
*int zmq_term (void '*context');*


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The _zmq_term()_ function terminates the 0MQ context 'context'.

If there are no longer any sockets open within 'context' at the time
_zmq_term()_ is called then 'context' shall be shut down and all associated
resources shall be released immediately.

Otherwise, the following applies:

* The _zmq_term()_ function shall return immediately.

* Any blocking operations currently in progress on sockets open within
  'context' shall return immediately with an error code of ETERM.

* With the exception of _zmq_close()_, any further operations on sockets open
  within 'context' shall fail with an error code of ETERM.

* The actual shutdown of 'context', and release of any associated resources,
  *shall be delayed* until the last socket within it is closed with
  _zmq_close()_.


RETURN VALUE
------------
The _zmq_term()_ function shall return zero if successful. Otherwise it shall
return `-1` and set 'errno' to one of the values defined below.


ERRORS
------
*EFAULT*::
The provided 'context' was not valid (NULL).
