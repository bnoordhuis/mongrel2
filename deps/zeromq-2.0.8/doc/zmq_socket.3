zmq_socket \- create 0MQ socket
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBvoid *zmq_socket (void \fR\fB\fI*context\fR\fR\fB, int \fR\fB\fItype\fR\fR\fB);\fR
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIzmq_socket()\fR function shall create a 0MQ socket within the specified \fIcontext\fR and return an opaque handle to the newly created socket\&. The \fItype\fR argument specifies the socket type, which determines the semantics of communication over the socket\&.
.sp
The newly created socket is initially unbound, and not associated with any endpoints\&. In order to establish a message flow a socket must first be connected to at least one endpoint with \fBzmq_connect\fR(3), or at least one endpoint must be created for accepting incoming connections with \fBzmq_bind\fR(3)\&.
.PP
\fBKey differences to conventional sockets\fR. Generally speaking, conventional sockets present a
\fIsynchronous\fR
interface to either connection\-oriented reliable byte streams (SOCK_STREAM), or connection\-less unreliable datagrams (SOCK_DGRAM)\&. In comparison, 0MQ sockets present an abstraction of an asynchronous
\fImessage queue\fR, with the exact queueing semantics depending on the socket type in use\&. Where conventional sockets transfer streams of bytes or discrete datagrams, 0MQ sockets transfer discrete
\fImessages\fR\&.
0MQ sockets being \fIasynchronous\fR means that the timings of the physical connection setup and teardown, reconnect and effective delivery are transparent to the user and organized by 0MQ itself\&. Further, messages may be \fIqueued\fR in the event that a peer is unavailable to receive them\&.
.sp
Conventional sockets allow only strict one\-to\-one (two peers), many\-to\-one (many clients, one server), or in some cases one\-to\-many (multicast) relationships\&. With the exception of \fIZMQ_PAIR\fR, 0MQ sockets may be connected \fBto multiple endpoints\fR using \fIzmq_connect()\fR, while simultaneously accepting incoming connections \fBfrom multiple endpoints\fR bound to the socket using \fIzmq_bind()\fR, thus allowing many\-to\-many relationships\&.
.PP
\fBSocket types\fR. The following sections present the socket types defined by 0MQ, grouped by the general
\fImessaging pattern\fR
which is built from related socket types\&.
.SS "Request\-reply pattern"
The request\-reply pattern is used for sending requests from a \fIclient\fR to one or more instances of a \fIservice\fR, and receiving subsequent replies to each request sent\&.

.br
ZMQ_REQ
.RS
A socket of type \fIZMQ_REQ\fR is used by a \fIclient\fR to send requests to and receive replies from a \fIservice\fR\&. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of \fIzmq_send(request)\fR and subsequent \fIzmq_recv(reply)\fR calls\&. Each request sent is load\-balanced among all \fIservices\fR, and each reply received is matched with the last issued request\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_REQ\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for all \fIservices\fR, or if there are no \fIservices\fR at all, then any \fBzmq_send\fR(3) operations on the socket shall block until the exceptional state ends or at least one \fIservice\fR becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded\&.

ZMQ_REP
.RS
A socket of type \fIZMQ_REP\fR is used by a \fIservice\fR to receive requests from and send replies to a \fIclient\fR\&. This socket type allows only an alternating sequence of \fIzmq_recv(request)\fR and subsequent \fIzmq_send(reply)\fR calls\&. Each request received is fair\-queued from among all \fIclients\fR, and each reply sent is routed to the \fIclient\fR that issued the last request\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_REP\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for a \fIclient\fR, then any replies sent to the \fIclient\fR in question shall be dropped until the exceptional state ends\&.

ZMQ_XREQ
.RS
A socket of type \fIZMQ_XREQ\fR is an advanced pattern used for extending request/reply sockets\&. Each message sent is load\-balanced among all connected peers, and each message received is fair\-queued from all connected peers\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_XREQ\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for all peers, or if there are no peers at all, then any \fBzmq_send\fR(3) operations on the socket shall block until the exceptional state ends or at least one peer becomes available for sending; messages are not discarded\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_XREQ\fR socket is connected to a \fIZMQ_REP\fR socket each message sent must consist of an empty message part, the \fIdelimiter\fR, followed by one or more \fIbody parts\fR\&.

ZMQ_XREP
.RS
A socket of type \fIZMQ_XREP\fR is an advanced pattern used for extending request/reply sockets\&. When receiving messages a \fIZMQ_XREP\fR socket shall prepend a message part containing the \fIidentity\fR of the originating peer to the message before passing it to the application\&. Messages received are fair\-queued from among all connected peers\&. When sending messages a \fIZMQ_XREP\fR socket shall remove the first part of the message and use it to determine the \fIidentity\fR of the peer the message shall be routed to\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_XREP\fR socket enters an exceptional state due to having reached the high water mark for all peers, or if there are no peers at all, then any messages sent to the socket shall be dropped until the exceptional state ends\&. Likewise, any messages routed to a non\-existent peer or a peer for which the individual high water mark has been reached shall also be dropped\&.
.sp
When a \fIZMQ_REQ\fR socket is connected to a \fIZMQ_XREP\fR socket, in addition to the \fIidentity\fR of the originating peer each message received shall contain an empty \fIdelimiter\fR message part\&. Hence, the entire structure of each received message as seen by the application becomes: one or more \fIidentity\fR parts, \fIdelimiter\fR part, one or more \fIbody parts\fR\&. When sending replies to a \fIZMQ_REQ\fR socket the application must include the \fIdelimiter\fR part\&.
